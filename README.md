# StudyDisciplineTimer
Sometimes while studying or working, I get distracted and switch to other tabs. To stay focused, I built this interval-based flash reminder app using Python and Tkinter. It shows a bright popup at set intervals to keep me on track. It’s useful for study discipline, avoiding distractions, and taking timed breaks.
