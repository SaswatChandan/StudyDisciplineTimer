## 📚 Why This Tool

Sometimes while studying or working, I get distracted and switch to other tabs for entertainment.  
To stay focused and reduce distraction, I built this timer app. It shows a bright, animated popup message at fixed intervals — to remind me to get back on track and stay disciplined.  

This tool works well for anyone who wants to:  
- Maintain study or work discipline  
- Avoid drifting into social media or distractions  
- Take regular, structured breaks (Pomodoro-style)  
- Build healthy habits around time and focus
